![Me, 2023](images/000-about@2x.webp)

Hi there!

My name is Alexey Pegov and this site is for photographs I've made.

But if you come for something else, I have also a separate place for my [work][] and another for my [blog][] (the blog is in Russian).

For the last 20 years or so I enjoy developing software. 

But beside that I really like shooting on black & white film with old cameras (one of my cameras is from sixties and another one is from beginning of eighties).

ps: You can reach me at iam[at]alexeypegov.com.
