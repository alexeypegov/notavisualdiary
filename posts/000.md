Hello there!

I'm Alexey Pegov, and this website showcases my photography work. However, if you're looking for something different, I also have dedicated spaces for my [professional work][] and [blog][] (which is in Russian).

Over the past two decades, I've found immense enjoyment in software development.

In addition to my passion for coding, I have a deep love for capturing moments on black and white film with vintage cameras, including one from the 1960s and another from the early 1980s.

I hope you have an enjoyable experience while visiting my site.
