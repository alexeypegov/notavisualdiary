Title: (not) a visual diary

Hi there!

My name is Alexey Pegov and I'm an amateur photographer.

This site showcases some of my work without a particular order or topic.

You can subscribe to updates via [Atom feed][atom] using your favorite RSS client (I prefer [Unread][] if you ask).

You can also follow me on [Mastodon][].

Or drop me a message in Signal: alexey.30

Now you can press the back button in your browser or [start over][home].

Enjoy!
